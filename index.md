# INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK DEVICES (PART 1)

- Open System Interconnection model
- Basic Network Devices

## Open System Interconnection model:

Was developed way to help disparate computing systems communication with each other.
Security can be place in various layers of OSI model to create a layered security arrangement that will improve the security of an overall performance

OSI LAYER:
```markdown
layer 7 = Application
Layer 6 = Presentation
Layer 5 = Session
Layer 4 = Transport
Layer 3 = Network
Layer 2 = Data Link
Layer 1 = Physical
```
## Basic Network Devices
- Switch
```markdown
> Utilized as an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit(ASIC) and considered as LAYER 2 OSI device:
 1. ASIC chip has specific programing that allow switch to learn when a device is on the network and which ports it is connected to cia that device's layer 2 MAC address.
> Managed switches allow for security to be placed on inviduals switch ports and creating more secure enviroment in networking
> Switch only communicate with local network devices.
```
- Wireless Access Point(WAP)
```markdown
> WAP is a specific type of network that connect wireless network segments with wired network segments and considered as as layer 2 OSI device:
  1. Wireless network segments WAP bridges (802.11)
  2. Ethernet network segments (802.3)
> WAP are capable to utilizing encyrption to help esure a secure network networking enviroment.
> WAP only communicate with local network devices
```
- Multilayer Switch (MLS)
```markdown
> MLS provides normal layer 2 network switching services, but also provide layer 3 or higher OSI model services.
> Most common MLS is a layer 3 switch.
> MLS commonly implements security at layer 2 and higher on OSI model.
```
- Router
```markdown
> Most common network device for connecting different network together utilizing the layer 3 OSI model logical network information.
> Router uses software programming for decision making, as compared to the switches use of an ASIC chip.
> Firewall and ACL usually placed on router to help secure networks


### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Tekasima99/StudySecurity-/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
