# INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK DEVICES (PART 1)

- Open System Interconnection model
- Basic Network Devices

## Open System Interconnection model:

Was developed way to help disparate computing systems communication with each other.
Security can be place in various layers of OSI model to create a layered security arrangement that will improve the security of an overall performance

OSI LAYER:
```markdown
layer 7 = Application
Layer 6 = Presentation
Layer 5 = Session
Layer 4 = Transport
Layer 3 = Network
Layer 2 = Data Link
Layer 1 = Physical
```
## Basic Network Devices
- Switch
```markdown
> Utilized as an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit(ASIC) and considered as LAYER 2 OSI device:
 1. ASIC chip has specific programing that allow switch to learn when a device is on the network and which ports it is connected       to cia that device's layer 2 MAC address.
> Managed switches allow for security to be placed on inviduals switch ports and creating more secure enviroment in networking
> Switch only communicate with local network devices.
```
```markdown
- Wireless Access Point(WAP)
> WAP is a specific type of network that connect wireless network segments with wired network segments and considered as as layer   2 OSI device:
  1. Wireless network segments WAP bridges (802.11)
  2. Ethernet network segments (802.3)
> WAP are capable to utilizing encyrption to help esure a secure network networking enviroment.
> WAP only communicate with local network devices
```
